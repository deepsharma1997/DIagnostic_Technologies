## Course Description <a name="course-description"></a>
This course brings engineering concepts and IT techniques together that are relevant to medical diagnostic and imaging demands. It will address the fundamentals of select human body systems (anatomy and physiology context), and how this relates to the physical principles of diagnostic radiology. Imaging 
modalities such as X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound etc. will be introduced. Computer assisted digital imaging techniques and image processing along with practical implementation of various imaging functions and intelligent analyses will be included.

## Labs Overview <a name="labs-overview"></a>
This exercise is designed to introduce and familiarize you with the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine-DICOM format and how it can be utilized and analyzed.This lab exercise aims to introduce and familiarize you with different image-processing techniques that are crucial for extracting meaningful features from medical images.
By the end of this, you will have the knowledge and tools to perform the following tasks in PYTHON:
* Load a DICOM file and display it.
* Create a stack of DICOM files, representing a volume.
* Perform simple analysis on the DICOM stack - identification/retrieval etc.
* Learn techniques to identify and outline the boundaries of objects within medical images.
* Learn techniques to eliminate or minimize background noise with the help of thresholding.
* Apply image enhancement techniques including scaling and histogram equalization on X-ray, CT, CTA, MRI images to enhance the imaging features. 

### Dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>
* Python 3.Ã—
* Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Nibabel, Matplotlib, open-cv, glob
* Google Colaboratory

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

* Datasets: The dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be downloaded from 
* Colaboratory allows you to use and share Jupyter notebooks with others without having to download, install, or run anything on your own computer (other than a browser).
